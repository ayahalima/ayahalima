Farewells of a Patriarch
BlueAthena
Summary:
The Wens for him or him for the Wens.
The blood of a monster for the blood of a father.
It wasn’t the hardest choice he’s had to make.
It was so far from it.
Notes:
(See the end of the work for notes.)



The letter looked so innocuous, a rectangle of cream white amongst the dark dirt tainted by corpses and death.
It was happenstance that Wei Wuxian had noticed its presence while mindlessly checking the wards at the borders.
The golden peony stamp seemed to mock him; the smoothness of the high-quality paper like hot coal against his pale skin, dyed cursed by sins.
Fingers still red from blood- the blood of Jin Zixuan, the blood of shijie’s Young Madam Jin’s husband, the blood of Jin Rulan’s father- opened the letter, each word within registering into his core like the drop of a boulder.
The Wens for Wei Wuxian or Wei Wuxian for the Wens.
The blood of a monster for the blood of a father.
Atonement with death for the widow and fatherless child.
It wasn’t the hardest choice he’s had to make.
It was so far from it.
Contrary to what many thought of Wei Wuxian, he was not ignorant of the machinations in politics. He was not deaf to the unspoken words behind amiable tones nor was he blind to the harsh goals one sets their sights on behind smiles.
Jin Guangshan didn’t give a damn for the Wens. They weren’t human in his eyes- they were an excuse, scapegoats. They’ll be slaughtered like livestock.
He wanted the Stygian Tiger Seal.
Wei Wuxian wanted to laugh. To laugh at how fucking hilarious this must be, for history to already be repeating itself with such vigour!
Golden peonies wanted to shine in place of the sun they shot down; gold wanted to dye the red the world had united to purge.
The Seal was a twisted mockery of a close comrade in his hand.
A weapon of resentful energy, just like Chenqing, just like its maker himself.
He never should’ve created the damn thing in the first place.
Then again, there’s a lot of things he never should’ve done in the first place but he did them anyway.
And look at where that got him and his loved ones…..if he even has the right to call them that anymore after what he’s done, what he’s become.
The cotton in his ears were a blessing in disguise, it made the shrieks of the Seal wash over him like rainwater. His fingers were bleeding, wisps of lingering resentful energy coiling with the trails of red that dripped down to seep into the cursed ground he stood on.
He gathered the shattered pieces of the Seal, stuffing it into his sleeve.
One job done. One more left to do.
He snuck into the Demon Slaughtering Cave- ah, the name truly is fitting now, isn’t it- and grabbed the brush and ink, grabbing the closest pieces of paper he could find and started to write.
The messages can only be read by the receiver themselves. Once they have done as such, it was burst into flames, never to be witnessed by anyone ever again.
He wrote the first to Wen Qing. She was strong, honourable, capable, practical and intelligent……and so very protective and caring to those she loved. He gained solace knowing that she considers him as one of the few loved ones in what remains of her family.
He apologized for leaving such a heavy burden on her shoulders, apologized for no longer being able to protect them despite vowing to do so; apologized for the hardships in the unforeseeable future he cannot help her brave through.
She’ll make the smart decision- the one to survive. She’s a survivor and a healer.
The world was big and lands vast, surely there was some place somewhere for the Wens to fade into obscurity.
He thought of A-Yuan- sweet, happy A-Yuan who fondly called him his ‘Xian-gege’, always affectionately clinging to his legs and giving warm hugs, freely giving smiles that made his bleak days brighter.
A-Yuan, his son.
A tear trailed down, a drop falling upon the surface of paper.
He would never get to see A-Yuan become Wei Yuan.
But maybe…..maybe he could be given another name.
Would he…..should he……can he ask this of him? Can the Yiling Patriarch truly ask the venerable Hanguang-jun to do this?
His mind flashed back to that blessed day in Yiling. That one day where he was able to live in an illusion of happiness.
He had looked so content with A-Yuan on his lap, golden eyes soft and happy as the little boy played with the numerous toys he bought him with innocent boundless joy.
And really, who better to give his son a chance at a better life than him?
He added these thoughts to Wen Qing’s letter before repeating them in Lan Zhan’s.
The brush paused, hesitating on the next strokes to form the message he wanted to leave.
There was so much Wei Ying wanted to tell him.
So much he wanted to confess.
So much he yearned for.
So much he had hoped for.
So much more he wanted to have.
So much they can never have.
He let himself pour a bit of selfishness into the last sentences.
(I’m sorry for being so selfish for so long. But I still want to be a bit selfish, I still want to have this friendship. I say these words as your soulmate; that day we spent together in Yiling was the most precious day of my life, I will hold it dear in my heart even in death.
Take care of my little radish, he is such a bright boy and he deserves so much but I can only give so little. I hope we can meet again in the next life. I hope I can be better for you to uphold the vow we made.
Thank you and farewell.)
He firmly placed the stopper down before his selfishness turned into an unstoppable flood.
Going to the next letter, he hesitated once more.
Should he…..should he tell Jiang Cheng the truth? Tell him the truth behind ‘Baoshan Sanren’? The truth about his Golden Core?
‘So what? So you can guilt-trip him? Be a burden to him? Didn’t you leave so you could avoid just that?’
He instead wrote what he should’ve said a long time ago- thank yous and sorrys.
(Thank you for putting up with my crazy half-assed ideas.)
(Thank you for being my brother.)
(I’m sorry that I’m breaking the promise we made, the promise to stay by your side as your right-hand, to be the Twin Heroes of Yunmeng.)
(I’m sorry for not being your brother.)
(I’m sorry for leeching off your father’s love and being a permanent stain on Yunmeng Jiang’s reputation.)
He didn’t hesitate to move onto the one meant for shijie Young Madam Jin.
But by the gods it was the hardest to write.
His grip was shaky, making his already messy calligraphy even worse. He forced himself not to shed anymore tears, lest he messed it up even more.
So many thank yous, too many sorrys and too little words to express each and every one of them.
(Thank you for loving me. Thank you for making anywhere be a home for me. Thank you for always cooking for me.)
(I’m sorry I wasn’t there to plan the most spectacular wedding for you. I’m sorry I failed as a brother. I’m sorry I left you a widow and your son to be raised fatherless. I’m sorry I couldn’t do more. I’m sorry that I couldn’t keep the promise to stay together with you and A-Cheng forever.)
He fished out the unassuming black box from his sleeve, the simple vessel containing the gift he poured his heart into making for young Jin Ling.
He attached it to the talisman. It would be delivered with the message. He would allow this last ounce of selfishness.
Now for the next job.
He placed Chenqing to his lips one more time. Wen Ning came and Wei Ying knew that signalled the turn of the hourglass.
He had to do this now, before Wen Qing found out- before anyone tried to stop him or delay the inevitable.
“Wei-gongzi, what-”
“Wen Ning….I have one last order for you.” He said.
Wen Ning’s eyes widened. Ah, he has always been perceptive, always thoughtful of others.
“Protect them, Wen Ning.” He grasped onto the sentient fierce corpse’s shoulder, eyes wide and pleading, each syllable weighed with the desperation of a dead man’s last wishes.
“I can’t do it anymore, Wen Ning. I’m sorry I have to leave. There’s no other way. I…I have to end this.” End the pain, the suffering. He was so tired of it. “I have to do this.”
“Wei-gongzi, calm down. Jiejie is looking for you, we can talk about this.” He tried to reassure.
Wei Ying chuckled, it held no warmth or humour.
“There’s nothing to talk about. I wish there was but there’s no time.” Then he straightened himself and stared at his friend in the eye.
“Protect them, Wen Ning. Do not let any of them come after me, do not let any of them step a li within Lanling Jin’s borders, do you understand? Just- run. Find another place, a better place, a safer haven and live on. Watch……” he swallowed. “Watch over them. Watch over A-Yuan, okay?”
Wen Ning’s eyes widened as the harsh implications of those words settled in.
This was farewell.
“No! Wei-gongzi, please, you can’t! Think about A-Yuan, think about Granny Wen, Uncle Four-”
“I’m doing this for them, Wen Ning.” Wei Wuxian said softly.
His gazed at him, imploring him to understand.
Wei Wuxian was tired.
He was tired of fighting.
He was tired of repaying debts.
He was tired of goddamn politics.
He was so…..so….tired of being broken.
The stitches that held together the patchwork of his being was fraying, just barely clinging by threads.
“Thank you for saving me and Jiang Cheng. Thank you for being a good friend. Don’t….don’t ever lose that kindness of yours.” Wei Wuxian said, patting his shoulders.
“It should me! I’m the one who killed Jin Zixuan, I’ll go in your place!” Wen Ning offered.
“I didn’t bring you back just so you could perish once more. You still have a sister to go back to. A family.” Wei Wuxian said, giving him a sad but resigned smile.
“So do you.” Wen Ning shot back.
“Then make sure you protect our family, yeah? Who knows? Maybe you can finally prove to Wen Qing that potatoes are clearly superior to radishes.” He joked half-heartedly.
Ah, pity he would never get to plant those potatoes.
But the words have been said, the orders have been delivered and the task has been set.
“Goodbye, Wen Ning.”
He sent another shrill note through Chenqing, forcing Wen Ning to return.
And thus, the Yiling Patriarch left the Burial Mounds, the demonic cultivator known for dancing hand-in-hand with death now walking towards his own.
‘I will walk alone on this single-plank bridge to its dark end.’
 
________________________________________
 
The worst part of the ostentatious Jinlintai was the stairs.
It was a literal drag to force his coreless malnourished body up the gaudy stairs. The glimmering gold encompassing the place seemed to mock his presence, gloating its finery.
Disgusting.
They all bathed in blood and showered in gold.
No one stepped in the way of the Yiling Patriarch.
No one opposed him ascending the stairs towards his end.
Of course, they would know of the ultimatum he was given. He would’ve expected more of an audience though.
Oh well.
Jin Guangshan was waiting at the top on his golden throne, his slimy face smug and so sure that he’s won.
Hurling the broken remains of the Stygian Tiger Seal at him brought a brief flare of vindictive satisfaction.
“There’s your Seal.” He spat.
Swords were drawn and he’ll bet that arrows were nocked somewhere.
He dropped down to his knees, eyes dull and resigned.
“The Yiling Patriarch surrenders.”
Jin Guangshan managed to recompose himself from both the loss of the Seal and from confirmation that he was here to surrender himself to their mercy.
“Oh?” he said, raising a brow nonchalantly.
Wei Ying gritted his teeth when he realized what the bastard was playing at- this wasn’t enough. He wanted him to prostrate himself, to plead and beg and grovel, to despair and shatter for the sake of his own twisted satisfaction.
Swallowing his pride, he knew- they both knew- that he only had one thing to lose.
And so he prostrated himself and kowtowed, begging for the remaining Dafan Wens to be spared.
Jin Guangshan of course, flippantly agreed but Wei Ying knew the snake would hunt them down like dogs the moment their only form of protection was out of the way.
He can only hope that Wen Qing had already started to evacuate.
Someone kicked him, hard and a rib cracked. He wheezed before fingers roughly seized him, yanking him up. Hands searched him, confiscating Chenqing and he offered not an ounce of resistance.
Chains dug into skin; talismans burned against flesh.
And like rabid dogs, the Jin disciples attacked.
“Monster!”
“Demon!”
“Why don’t you fight back, huh? Why don’t you cry for your Ghost General to save your ass?”
“Die you bastard!”
“Devil’s incarnate!”
A hysterical laugh spilled out of his lips, bubbling past gurgling blood and red-stained teeth, echoing throughout the tower like a haunting bell in a cursed city.
He laughed and laughed as his sanity spilled through his grasp like sand. He laughed even if it rattled his bones and jostled his organs.
“How fucking fitting!” he spat. “You Jins really are like the Wens! Just gold instead of red.”
“Shut up!” a boot kicked his head, knocking him to the side as stars burst across his vision.
He spat out a mouthful of blood and grinned, like a wolf baring its fangs.
“I’m sorry.” He said, tone oozing with mockery. He tilted his head. “All I can hear is the bark of rabid dogs.”
His laughter was cut off as a heel grinded against his airpipe.
“You filth. You were nothing but the son of a servant. Now you’re no better than a dog yourself!” one of them spat at him.
“Bark doggie. Bark!” one of them mocked.
“Bark and we’ll loosen the chains on you.”
They started to imitate the barking of dogs, the barks echoing in his ears like a never-ending pour of salt over fresh wounds.
Barking of dogs.
Blinding gold and nauseating peonies.
And suddenly, the Yiling Patriarch was a street urchin in tattered rags cowering from mangy street dogs in a dirty alley while desperately trying to cling onto the meagre food he managed to salvage.
‘So many dogs…..’
Dark spots danced across his vision; his mind was detaching from the pain flaring all over his body; his eyelids were so….so….heavy….
‘A-Cheng, didn’t you promise to chase away the dogs?’
But A-Cheng wasn’t here. He wouldn’t want to be here anyways.
 
________________________________________
 
A wave of cold slammed into him with the force of a house, harshly yanking him to the surface of consciousness.
He spluttered, water entering his mouth and nose, his threadbare clothes utterly drenched.
“Get up.” A Jin disciple spat, throwing the bucket aside.
Wei Wuxian’s eyes were dazed as though he were in a trance; his body submissive, offering no protest as manacles clamped over his wrists, another on his ankles and even one around his neck like a noose.
Fingers painfully dug into his jaw while another fisted his locks, forcefully yanking his head up. A gag was stuffed into his mouth and secured around his jaw, burning against his sunken cheeks.
As he was yanked along like a dog on a leash, he hazily tried to figure out where the hell he was right now.
He’s surprised he wasn’t dead yet, surprised that the Jins hadn’t already chopped his head off and placed it on a stake to lord over the other sects.
As the deafening roar of thousands of gathered cultivators assaulted his ears, with a jolt, he realized where he was.
Nightless City.
Once again, he felt the bitterness boil inside him, another hysterical laughter bubbling from behind the gag, tears constricting his neck because all of this was just. So. Fucking. Ironic.
It was laughable, really, how it all cycled back to this.
Nightless City, where one bloodshed ended only to mark the beginning of another.
Nightless City, where one tyrant was killed and where another villain of the cultivation world would meet his end.
Of course, this would happen- of course, Jin Guangshan would make a spectacle out of him, would never hesitate to stir in douses of drama.
Ah, at least he’ll have an audience to witness his end. Such drama, such suspense! What ‘villain’ could ask for a better end than this?
As he was dragged towards a raised dais, words were hurled at him- as though the sheer volume and the number of repeated insults or curses could materialize into actual things to hit him.
Then there were the actual things- rocks and vegetables, the former leaving bruises that barely twinged and latter staining long-ruined robes.
The walk to the dais felt too long and his arrival on top too soon. The back of his knees were struck, forcing him down to the ground.
“We gather here today to witness as a villain bathed in sins meets his comeuppance! As karma at last is executed upon an entity of evil!”
A roar rose from the crowd, resonating throughout the entirety of what was once Qishan Wen’s impregnable domain.
He couldn’t give two shits for the riveting speech- tuning it out as though it were no more than the drone of a mosquito.
Orbs the colour of ashes listlessly scanned the masses, surprised to not see prideful purple mixed with the plethora of cultivators.
He supposed that was another small solace in his final moments.
For some reason, he gazed at the spots of white- a dying ember of what’s left in his beating heart hoping against pointless hope that he might see Lan Zhan one last time.
Even if it was a sneer of disgust, a frown of disappointment, a blank cold gaze of apathy, a storm of anger- he just wants to see those eyes of molten gold one more time, selfish as that was.
He did not find him. He wasn’t sure if that was a blessing or a curse.
He was snapped back into awareness as someone yanked his long locks. He hissed at the pain flaring from his scalp.
There was a glint of metal in his peripheral-
And he jolted forward, the tautness between his scalp gone like the snap of a bowstring and…..
And…….
His neck felt naked, his head felt too light. There were black locks littering the ground-
Oh.
They sliced his hair off, the remaining locks barely reaching past his shoulders.
The crowd roared once more, the sound surely penetrating to the heavens above.
Vengeful approval, vindictive satisfaction, bloodthirsty pleasure-
It was revolting.
“Fitting style for a war criminal, no? Could use some trimming I suppose.” Jin Guangshan mocked.
The crowd laughed and hooted, jeered and cheered.
Sheep. Cattle. No better than animals, all of them.
They were dogs.
He wanted someone to chase them away.
His back was slammed against a stake, talismans binding him against it like a beanstalk. Wood and hay was gathered by his feet and the gag was yanked out of his mouth, another talisman wrapping around his neck like a phyton, making him gasp for breath.
The orange glow of flames from a torch was casted upon his gaunt face.
He watched, unfazed as the flame were brought close enough for his to smell its suffocating smoke, to taste the ash on his tongue and have its tongues splutter and brush against his skin.
“Burn in hell, you bastard.”
It was only fitting, wasn’t it? Poetic even. He deserved to burn- after all, he himself walked side-by-side with the same sun they had all united to shoot down.
And this way, once his ashes were scattered like dust to the winds, he would have no chance to return as a fierce corpse like the horrific Ghost General.
‘Ah….Granny Wen just patched these up for me.’ He thought morosely as flames licked the hems of his trousers.
More torches were hurled, flame talismans were cast and even plain sticks and stones battered against him, egging the gluttonous fire to devour more.
He would not scream. He would not beg or sob or go all hysterical. He will not give them that satisfaction.
He is dying, he has long since resigned himself to that inevitable fact.
The flames were up to his shins now.
Were the Wens evacuating as he burned? Were Granny Wen’s painful knees acting up? Was A-Yuan crying and asking for his Xian-gege?
The last thought hurt more than the flames steadily rising to his knees.
“A-Yuan……”
His voice was no louder than a dandelion seed in the wind.
He will not see the child grow up into a fine young man- will not be able to read him fun stories or make silly faces, will not pick him up and hug him; will not play with him or make up new games; will not get to see him potentially develop a Golden Core and grow into a cultivator; will never teach him how to play the dizi or hold a sword-
So many possibilities, too many lost chances.
All of it like the rise of smoke from a blazing bonfire.
The flames were past his knees.
“Come back to Gusu with me.”
How he wished he could! How he wished he could’ve simply said yes and accepted- to be able to tease him and rile him up without the constant invisible barrier dancing around them.
But alas, how could the malicious Yiling Patriarch defile the venerable Hanguang-jun?
He wished he could’ve done so many things with Lan Zhan as Wei Ying.
He wished he could’ve broken more rules just to get his attention; wished he could get Lan Zhan drunk one more time for sillies; to feed the rabbits with him; to night hunt with him and help the weak, protect the innocent and serve justice; to fluster him and see his ears turn red in the endearing way it always did.
He wished……
He wished he had a chance to pursue rather than yearn; to woo rather than tease; to embrace rather than endure…….
So many wishes, too many regrets.
The flames were almost at his neck now.
He was crying. The tears on his face were warmer than the fire; the gaping chasm in his heart more agonizing than resentful energy.
Yet, his mind felt startlingly clear- a relinquishing clarity that left him euphoric.
‘Ah, so this is the end of the Yiling Patriarch.’
“WEI WUXIAN!”
Purple glow- no….purple lightning. Yells of anger and waves of rage masking wailing desperation. Shoves and curses; demands and despair.
‘Jiang Cheng? Aish, even in my final moments, I can’t have peace. Always so loud…so harsh……no wonder he’ll always be single…………
‘Madam Yu? I kept my promise. Please don’t whip me in the afterlife…..’
The flames were tickling his chin.
“-Ying. Wei Ying!”
An echo desperate to be heard.
He tilted his head back and saw an ethereal being clad in snow white flying towards him, crying for his name the same way a heartbroken soulmate would cry for their significant other.
“Lan Zhan…….”
He came. He came to bid him goodbye.
This time, the tears weren’t as heavy against his face. They were clearer and lighter than he’s felt in ages.
“Lan Zhan…….” Wei Ying breathed.
He wanted to at least savour the name of his soulmate in his dying breaths.
“WEI YING!”
Such a beautiful face carved from jade should not look so distraught. It was wrong. He wanted to tenderly cup his face, kiss his tears away, gently comb his fingers through that silken hair, hum him a song…….
‘Ah……’
Regrets increased a thousandfold as he belatedly realized one last thing.
‘I never got to learn the name of that song.’
Yet, in his heart, it was as clear as day.
That was a balm against the jagged fragments of his heart.
And thus, the Yiling Patriarch died with a wistful smile on his face and a nameless song in his heart.

Summary:
Have been hiding my feelings, avoiding messes while following rules,
Have played a melody and got drunk with a single cup in Gusu,
How can I stop caring about you?
Known to show up whenever there is trouble,
Even this cloud patterned band can constrain me no more.

~同道殊途 (Our Different Paths)
Notes:
I want to make it clear that this is only a grain of sand from the beach I have planned. I just wanted to write a straightforward glimpse of LWJ's immediate reaction right after.....you know. I promise that I will write a proper fic someday that weaves together everything from the beginning to end.
(See the end of the work for more notes.)
Lan Wangji remembers fire.
He remembers fire from the glow of lanterns and candles; he remembers fire from the source of warmth when camping in the wild; he remembers fire from the hustle and bustle of cooking in kitchens and markets.
He remembers fire from the smell of smoke and the taste of ash on his tongue as paper burned to ashes and wood to charred black. He remembers fire from the spluttering tongues licking at his robes and the sparks agitating his exposed skin like burning needles. He remembers fire with loss and pain and death and grief and anger- so much anger and resentment and an unsatiable thirst dangerously edged on hate.
But from this day forth, Lan Wangji will never forget fire as a glutton.
Fire has already taken so much from him.
Fire desecrated his home; took away his father and almost his brother; burned his innocence and contentment; ruined his life; broken him time and time again leaving scars from war and death and destruction-
And now fire has taken away his soulmate.
His zhiji.
The true lord who bore the light in his life.
Gone.
Burned.
Gone.
Killed.
Gone.
Executed.
Gone.
Dead-
The fire at the stake was still burning vivid orange, the smoke in his throat was a noose on his neck and clarity gradually being drowned in a red haze.
He was on the dais- the same dais Wei Ying had stood on, had knelt on as he was humiliated and spat on by the cultivation world- and staring at the stake in a daze as though if he stared long enough, Wei Ying will walk out of the smoke, covered in ashes but smiling like the sun itself, eyes as beautiful as moonbeams and he’ll be alive, he’ll laugh it off, he’ll be okay-
“Ah, Hanguang-jun.” Jin Guangshan, the Sect Leader….no, the murderer and executer of the ‘villainous’ Yiling Patriarch welcomed, smile as cold as the gold he loved and words like vinegar. “I apologize for not giving you the honour of-”
Honour? Honour?!
This man- this disgusting revolting arrogant selfish power-hungry tyrant deemed the execution of a man who only sought to live the rest of his days as a radish farmer an honour?!
This man who sought to slaughter a group of elderly, women and a child just for the surname they bore as justice?!
The red haze condensed into an ocean.
And-
Lan Wangji, Hanguang-jun, the Light-Bearing Lord-
He dove right in.
He submerged in it.
By the time he floated to the surface, Bichen was already buried halfway through Jin Guangshan’s stomach, skewering him like the pig he was.
“HANGUANG-JUN HAS GONE MAD!”
“He’s possessed-!”
“Resentful spirits of the Wens-”
“THE YILING LAOZU’S SPIRIT HAS POSSESSED HIM!”
The uproar was muted in Lan Wangji’s ears, still stuffed with cotton and water from the ocean he’d lost himself into moments ago.
Bichen was yanked out, his wrist flicking the blade to free it of the tainted blood belonging to the corrupted man who manipulated the whole world into pushing their debts onto one man who was the one reason they even had a proper world left to live in.
Red blossomed over golden peonies.
More peonies flocked to save him.
Swords were drawn.
Time lost cohesion.
But numbers did not.
33.
33 drew their swords and pointed them at Lan Wangji.
33 fought against Lan Wangji.
33 fell before him.
33 were injured gravely.
33 were sacrificed before Lan Wangji was bounded by the Lan Elders and forcefully manhandled back to Cloud Recesses.
 
________________________________________
 
33 lashes were carved upon his back like the sacred rules upon the Wall of Discipline.
33 lashes of devotion and failure carried within each scar.
33 lashes upon a shattered jade.
Notes:
I apologize in advance for the short chapter and if I depicted LWJ as a bit OOC. Then again, if he didn't hesitate to rebel against 33 Lan Elders after a battle, I wouldn't put it past him to be consumed by an even bigger rage towards JGS who literally just went ahead and gave WWX a slow torturous death after he surrendered without resistance. And frankly, JGS deserves a thousand times more than a mere stab to the stomach.
Should JGS live after this? Should he barely cling onto life and die anyways some point down the line? I'll let you, the readers decide. Please let me know your decision in the comments below. You have until 24th March 2021 to submit. ; )
Heaps of thanks to every and all who have read and supported my fics including this one and the one before it. Please let me know what you think in the comments below, constructive criticism is welcomed, stay safe, stay healthy and stay sane.
Bye!
